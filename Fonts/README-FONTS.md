### HangoutPullables -> Fonts
Some of the applications you use as part of the Max's Hangout community rely on certain fonts to make it look better. I've collected a simple list of these fonts, you can download all of them and install them directly to your machine, ensuring you get the "best visual experience" of my apps. (The GUI will probably still look horrible!)
